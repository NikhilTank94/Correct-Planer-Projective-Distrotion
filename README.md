# Correcting-Planer-Projective-Distrotion
The goal here is to remove planar perspective distortion which was discussed in class at length. Take an image of a wall of the CISE building using your digital camera. Make sure that you take the image from a suciently oblique view point in order for the image to contain enough distortion. Develop MATLAB code to:

(i) remove this planar perspective distortion using the linear algorithm (called DLT) discussed in class; 

(ii) have some fun with the perspective image of the wall of the CISE building by generating two new perspectives from the same camera center. Note that the mapping between two perspectives is a homography.
